Freimap is a visualization environment for community mesh networks with
an OLSR infrastructure. Think "freifunk.net". 

Documentation of the project is still expected to fall from the sky. 
Until then, here's a small outlook of what you can get running and how.

== Requirements ==

* Java 1.5.0 (Java2) or better (GCJ and GNU Classpath+Cacao works, but is slow and unstable)
* Either 
** olsr daemon running with the dot_draw plugin in the network
** a database containing topology data, according to the provided SQL structure. 
** a server running the FreifunkMap software (http://www.layereight.de/software_freifunkmap.php)
* A few, rather common java libraries which are also provided in a separate convenience package
*# jFreeChart (1.0.4 checked) and jCommon (1.0.8 checked) from jfree.org
*# Mysql J/Connector if database access is used (version 5.0.5 checked)
*optional: an OpenStreetMap mapnik server providing tiles

== Installation == 

=== from convenience JAR archive ===

Assuming that you have the file freimap-all-*.jar in a convenient location.

 > unzip freimap-all-*.jar lib/*
:(will create a ./lib subfolder and extract libraries)

You're done. 

=== Compile from source jar archive === 

 > mkdir freimap
* Copy the jar file into this folder. 
 > jar xvf freimap-dev-*.jar 
:(will create many a subfolder)
 > ./compile 
:(should compile the necessary files with a well-defined classpath, and create a jar file freimap.jar. If not, you'll have to adjust the file)

=== Get the latest from SVN ===

* Follow the instructions at http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=8309 to obtain an up-to date source tree.
 > ./compile
or, if you have ant installed:
 > ant  

== Running freimap ==

By now, you should have the file freimap*.jar and a lib subfolder.

Copy config.yaml.example to config.yaml. Edit to taste. The configuration defaults to read a dot topology on localhost:2004. 

 > ./run 
or 
 > java -Xmx500m -jar freimap-*.jar

If you have got less than 500mb free memory, you may want to adjust the 
-Xmx parameter. Freimap does not necessarily need that much unless you 
evaluate many months of collected data using the MysqlDataSource. 


== Using freimap ==

You need geo-information for your network. Currently, this can be read 
either from a Mysql Database, a nodes.dump file in the jar package or
from a FreifunkMap server.

The nodes.dump file however only provides data for nodes for a few
networks around Berlin and Leipzig currently. Importing from other
sources is on my to do list, suggestions are welcome. 

In the main window, you will therefore see a number of white clouds at
first. They are the big node concentrations around Berlin and Leipzig.
Drag and zoom using your left and right mouse buttons to get closer to
the area where you expect to see your network. Press the play button at
the bottom of the screen to get live updates and display topology. (If you
don't see anything, try to zoom in near Berlin, Alexanderplatz where a big
green c-base logo is located. Any node which could not be located is currently
placed there - see [[Freimap/Troubleshooting]])

=== Configuration options ===

Obsolete. The new YAML syntax differs slightly but significantly.
I am keeping this here, as the options are basically the same.

==== DataSource ====
Set this to either net.relet.freimap.OLSRDDataSource, net.relet.freimap.MysqlDataSource
or net.relet.freimap.FreifunkMapDataSource.

When using OLSRDataSource the dotdraw plugin of a running OLSR daemon is accessed to
retrieve live stats about the mesh-net.

When using  MysqlDataSource a MySQL database retrieves this information.

When using FreifunkMapDataSource the data is retrieved from a server running the 
FreifunkMap scripts.

==== background ====
Set this either to blank, images, openstreetmap in order to paint the application's
background with nothing, some images which are specified in the config file or
pre-rendered tiles of OpenStreetMap.

==== ffmds.url ====
URL for a server running the FreifunkMap scripts or a local file which contains the
data the server would normally create.

The default configuration uses some sample data.

This is only needed if you use the FreifunkMapDataSource.

==== yaml.url ====
No idea.

==== olsrd.host, olsrd.port ====
IP address and port of an OLSR daemon running the dotdraw plugin.

This is only needed if you use the OLSRDDataSource.

==== olsrd.nodefile ===
A file providing geographic information about OLSR nodes. The string
specifies a Java system resources. If unsure do not change the default.

This is only needed if you use the OLSRDDataSource.

==== mysql.host, mysql.user, mysql.user, mysql.pass, mysql.db, mysql.tables.nodes, mysql.tables.links ====
Credentials and table names for a MySQL database providing node data.

This is only needed if you use the MysqlDataSource.

==== image.count ====
The number of image entries in the config file.

==== image.X.gfx, image.X.lat, image.X.lon, image.X.scale ====
An image entry where 'X' is a number. 'image.X.gfx' is a Java system resource string.
This means that your images must be available via the application's classpath.

=== Interface ===

The main screen is a map where you can zoom and drag around. Status bars at the top and bottom will tell you about the currently displayed time and the geographical position equivalent to your mouse cursor. 

* Left mouse button: Click and drag to move around the map
* Double click left on any place in the screen to center onto that place.
* Move your mouse over a node or a link to display basic information
* Right click onto a node or link to display advanced statistics. The displayed graphs require a certain minimum of time samples to be available, so that they may not work until after a certain while. 
* Click and drag along the time line on the bottom of the screen to display information about another point in time.
* Click on the play/stop button to display a singe time or move forward within it. 
* A drop down box at the top left of the screen allows you to center on a certain node. Since there are more than thousand registered nodes, it's not that useful currently.
